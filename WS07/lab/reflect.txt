Okay, this week was very long and productive as I took approximately 7 days to deep study OOP from scratch after failing the midterms.
I binged YouTube videos, read study notes, and reviewed class documents.

After my review, I finally understand perfectly the concepts of: 
1. Operator overloading
2. Lazy evaluation
3. Different ways to initialize
4. Initializing constructors with the member initializer list
5. Inheritance

I still need more time to study Virtual functions and to perfect how to use copy constructors and assignments.
Also, I still get confused by how and when to use "const" and "this".

About the workshop and milestone this week,
This is the first time I'll really do a workshop with very little external research and it felt fairly simple. I guess the midterms woke me up.
