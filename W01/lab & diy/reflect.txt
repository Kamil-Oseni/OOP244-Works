//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.



TOPICS I LEARNED IN COMPLETING THIS WORKSHOP
-------------------------------------------
* File Manipulation (Closing a file to avoid memory leak. Rewinding a file, Opening and reading a file)
* Modular Programming
* String and substring comparison


* File Manipulation
	I learned that in order to open a file I have to create the file pointer "FILE* fptr = fopen(fileName, "r");" and the "r" indicates that I will be reading from the file, if i were to be writing, I'd use "w".
	I learned that the rewind function helps to reposition the file pointer to the beginning of the file.
	I also learned that I need to close the file after manipulation to avoid memory leak.

* Modular Programming
	After doing this workshop, I understand the need to have separate files that work together, it helped structure my code, organized it and made it easier to read, understand and comment on.
	It also made debuging and testing my code easier.
	Because of modular programming, cStrTools was easy to reuse without rewriting the code.

* String and Substring Comparison
	I learned how to how to check if a string is a substring of another string by using the already created function.





ISSUES THAT CAUSED DIFFICULTIES
-------------------------------
* At first i used a struct and passed integer data types for the number and prefix, so in my output for numbers starting with a zero the compiler ignored the zero, i.e compiler was printing "630" rather than "0630".
and to fix this, i changed all integer types to char data types.

* Another issue I had was I was getting a memory leak in the matrix compiler because I forgot to close the file.
