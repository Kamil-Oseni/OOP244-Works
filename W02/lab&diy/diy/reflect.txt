//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.


This was a very very very draining workshop, I hope it even passes the matrix submission (fingers crossed).

Here is how my logic process went for this workshop:

Part 1 was quite easy, and I started with the Force being with me like from last week (Star Wars reference). 
While reading the instructions and writing out my pseudocode, I thought it would be interesting to use a class in place of the struct like we learned in class,
but after going through the instructions, and just like Bart Simpson said "There's only one thing to do at a moment like this: Strut!" (Struct).

Other than having issues with the load function, things i learned and utilized were:

1. Using Extern - I asked a question in class about using Extern and while doing the workshop, I had a problem with a memory leak, I remembered and implemented Extern.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation- I've learned how to use dynamic memory allocation to generate arrays using the new operator, and that dynamic memory allocation is managed 
	by the operating system and occurs at runtime rather than at compile time.

3. Also the use of function overloading made my work easier and like my profeessor says "it's a beautiful thing".
