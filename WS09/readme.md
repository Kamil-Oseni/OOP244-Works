# Workshop 9: Derived Class with a Resource

* Version 1
* Version 1.1 Added using namespace sdds to main.cpp

In this workshop, you are to code/complete two classes:

- Student: A class that holds the name and age of the student.
- Graduate: A class which is inherited from the Student class and holds the name of the thesis and the supervisor.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- Apply the rule of three to a class and its descendants. 
- Describe what you have learned in completing this workshop


## Submission Policy


The workshop is divided into one coding part and one non-coding part:

- Part 1 (**LAB**): A step-by-step guided workshop, worth 100% of the workshop's total mark
> Please note that the part 1 section is **not to be started in your first session of the week**. You should start it on your own before the day of your class and join the first session of the week to ask for help and correct your mistakes (if there are any).
- Part 2 (reflection): non-coding part. The reflection doesn't have marks associated with it but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).

## Due Dates

The Due dates depend on your section. Please choose the "-due" option of the submitter program to see the exact due date of your section:

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY_sss -due<ENTER>
```
- Replace **??** with your subject code (`00 or 44`)
- Replace **X** with Workshop number: [`1 to 10`]
- Replace **Y** with the part number: [`1 or 2`]
- Replace **sss** with the section: [`naa, nbb, nra, zaa, etc...`]

## Late penalties
You are allowed to submit your work up to 2 days after the due date with a 30% penalty for each day. After that, the submission will be closed and the mark will be zero.

## Citation

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top:<br />
**your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

### For work that is done entirely by you (ONLY YOU)

If the file contains only your work or the work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

### For work that is done partially by you.

If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment is given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrongdoing.

> - Add the citation to the file in which you have the borrowed code
> - In the 'reflect.txt` submission of part 2 (DIY), add exactly what is added to which file and from where (or whom).

> :warning: This [Submission Policy](#submission-policy) only applies to the workshops. All other assessments in this subject have their own submission policies.

### If you have helped someone with your code

If you have helped someone with your code. Let them know of these regulations and in your 'reflect.txt' of part 2 (DIY), write exactly which part of your code was copied and who was the recipient of this code.<br />By doing this you will be clear of any wrongdoing if the recipient of the code does not honour these regulations.

## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the C++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as follows to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.

> Note: All the code written in workshops and the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace, unless instructed otherwise.

### Custom code submission

If you have any additional custom code, (i.e. functions, classes etc) that you want to reuse in the workshop save them under a module called Utils (`Utils.cpp and Utils.h`) and submit them with your workshop using the instructions in the "[Submitting Utils Module](#submitting-utils-module)" section.


> Note: All the code written in workshops and the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace.
# Part 1 - LAB (100%)

## Student Class
This class holds the name and the age of the student privately. The name is held dynamically. 

This class should have at least the following:

### Constructors and Methods
#### A default constructor
This should set the object to a safe empty state. 

#### A parameterized constructor
This constructor receives the name and the age of the student.  A copy of the name is dynamically held by the name pointer in the class and the age attribute is set to the age argument.

#### The rule of three
Implement the rule of three so the allocated memory is managed properly in case of copying, assignment and destruction. Keep in mind that this class is being inherited into a "Graduate" class and the destruction of the student should guarantee that the descendants of the class are destructed properly as well. 

#### void display()
This method simply displays the name and age of the student as follows (if the student's name is "John Doe" and the age is 35):

```text
Name: John Doe
Age: 35
```

## Graduate Class
This class should inherit from the Student class and hold the name of the supervisor and title of the thesis for this Graduate student dynamically.

This class should have at least the following:

### Constructors and Methods
#### A default constructor
This should set the object to a safe empty state. 

#### A parameterized constructor
This constructor should be able to appropriately allocate the heap memory for the thesis title and supervisor name along with making these pointers point to the appropriate heap memory. Make sure to map this constructor to the parameterized constructor of the parent class.

#### The rule of three
Implement the rule of three so the allocated memory is managed properly in case of copying and assignment. Make sure to map this to the appropriate parent operator.

#### void display()
This method simply displays the name and age of the student along with the Thesis title and name of the supervisor as follows (if the student's name is "Jane Doe", 25 years old, working on "Blackholes and Event Horizon"  under the supervision of "Professor Stephen Hawking".

```text
Name: Jane Doe
Age: 25
Thesis Title: Blackholes and Event Horizon
Supervisor: Professor Stephen Hawking
---------------------------------------------
```
