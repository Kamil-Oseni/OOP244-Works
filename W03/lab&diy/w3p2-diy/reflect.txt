Other than having issues with the load and transfer functions, the things I learned and utilized this week were:

1. Function Overloading-I am growing my skills in function overloading .just like in the functions  void set(constchar*trainName);void set(int noOfPassengers, int departure); 
void set(const char* trainName, int noOfPassengers, int departure); Where every function is called in a different way.

2. Member functions: I have learned how to use member functions with the help of the scope resolution operator. Using the private and public member functions I can say it helps organize code logically, 
Member functions can be reused across different parts of the program and Member functions provide controlled access to the internal state of an object.

3. Privacy: I have learned the importance of making variables and functions private and protected because it ensures proper encapsulation and controlling access to the internal components of a class.
